Group Generator

Create a Group Generator app, which will be used to assign group members to different groups.
The Group Generator has to assign names randomly to each group. It should take into consideration
that the sizes of the groups is maximum 4 people.

Features

a. Make it so that when a group reaches 4 members it is disabled.
b. It should be possible to specify the amount of groups you want to create.
c. When inputting a name, that name should immediately be assigned to a group.
d. Show it visually when a group is full.
e. Make it possible to change the maximum amount of people in each group and the number of groups.
f. Add drag and drop functionality, so if necessary the groups can be manually changed after formation.
